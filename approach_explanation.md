# Approach Explanation - Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Methodology Overview

Our solution implements a multi-layered intelligence system that transforms raw PDF documents into persona-relevant content through sophisticated relevance scoring and section extraction.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
The **PDFProcessor** component extracts text while preserving document structure using PyMuPDF. Unlike simple text extraction, our approach identifies meaningful content sections by detecting substantial headings and content blocks rather than relying solely on formatting cues. The system uses pattern matching to identify section boundaries and applies fallback mechanisms for documents with irregular structure.

### 2. Intelligent Section Detection
We move beyond traditional heading detection by implementing a semantic-aware section identification system. The processor looks for substantial content blocks (>50 words) with meaningful titles, focusing on content that provides actionable information. This approach ensures we capture valuable content even in documents with inconsistent formatting.

### 3. Multi-Dimensional Relevance Scoring
The **PersonaAnalyzer** employs a four-pronged scoring methodology:

**Keyword-Based Relevance (25%)**: Matches content against persona-specific and job-related terminology, with weighted scoring favoring domain-specific terms.

**TF-IDF Similarity (25%)**: Computes document-persona similarity using term frequency analysis, enabling the system to understand content relevance beyond simple keyword matching.

**Semantic Similarity (25%)**: Leverages sentence transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for deep contextual understanding, capturing semantic relationships between persona requirements and document content.

**Content Quality Assessment (25%)**: Evaluates section substance, length, and relevance indicators while penalizing generic content (introductions, conclusions) that provides limited actionable value.

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient text processing with minimal memory footprint
- Cached model loading to stay within 1GB constraint
- Streamlined section detection algorithms
- Batch processing for semantic similarity calculations

### Generalization Strategy
Our system handles diverse domains by:
- Dynamic keyword extraction from job descriptions
- Domain-agnostic content quality metrics
- Flexible section detection patterns
- Persona-adaptive scoring weights

## Output Generation
The system ranks all identified sections by combined relevance scores, extracts the top 10 most relevant sections, and generates detailed subsection analysis from the top 5 sections. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage while focusing on the most pertinent content for the given persona and task.

## Constraints Compliance
- **CPU-only operation**: No GPU dependencies
- **Model size**: <1GB (sentence transformer model ~90MB)
- **Processing time**: Optimized for <60 seconds
- **Offline capability**: All models cached locally
- **Memory efficiency**: Designed for 16GB RAM systems
