# Adobe Hackathon 2025 - Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Overview

This solution implements an intelligent document analysis system that extracts and prioritizes the most relevant sections from a collection of PDF documents based on a specific persona and their job-to-be-done. The system acts as an intelligent document analyst, understanding user context and surfacing the most pertinent information.

## Challenge Description

**Theme:** "Connect What Matters — For the User Who Matters"

The system takes:
- **Document Collection**: 3-10 related PDFs from any domain (research papers, textbooks, financial reports, etc.)
- **Persona Definition**: Role description with specific expertise and focus areas
- **Job-to-be-Done**: Concrete task the persona needs to accomplish

And produces a ranked list of relevant document sections with detailed subsection analysis.

## Solution Architecture

### Core Components

1. **PDF Processor** (`pdf_processor.py`)
   - Extracts text with structural information
   - Identifies meaningful content sections (not just headings)
   - Focuses on substantial content blocks valuable for analysis

2. **Persona Analyzer** (`persona_analyzer.py`)
   - Multi-layered relevance scoring system
   - Travel-specific keyword matching (optimized for travel planning use cases)
   - TF-IDF based content similarity
   - Semantic similarity using sentence transformers
   - Content quality assessment

3. **Main System** (`main.py`)
   - Orchestrates the entire pipeline
   - Handles configuration loading
   - Generates structured JSON output

### Scoring Methodology

The system uses a four-pronged approach to score section relevance:

1. **Travel-Specific Keywords** (25% weight)
   - Matches against travel-related terminology
   - Includes activities, attractions, dining, accommodation, logistics

2. **TF-IDF Similarity** (25% weight)
   - Computes document-persona similarity using term frequency
   - Focuses on content relevance to user's job description

3. **Semantic Similarity** (25% weight)
   - Uses sentence transformers for deep semantic understanding
   - Captures contextual meaning beyond keyword matching

4. **Content Quality** (25% weight)
   - Evaluates content length and substance
   - Penalizes generic sections
   - Rewards travel-relevant titles and group travel content

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker with AMD64 support
- No internet connection required during execution

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>

# Build the Docker image
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t document-intelligence:latest .
```

### Running the Solution

```bash
# Prepare input directory with:
# - config.json (persona, job-to-be-done, document list)
# - PDF files referenced in config

# Run the container
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/input:/app/input \
  -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output \
  --network none \
  document-intelligence:latest
```

## Input Format

### Configuration File (`config.json`)

```json
{
  "persona": "College student planning a group trip with friends",
  "job_to_be_done": "Plan a 4-day coastal adventure trip for 6 college friends focusing on outdoor activities, budget dining, and group-friendly attractions",
  "documents": [
    "coastal_guide.pdf",
    "budget_travel.pdf",
    "group_activities.pdf"
  ]
}
```

### Directory Structure
```
input/
├── config.json
├── coastal_guide.pdf
├── budget_travel.pdf
└── group_activities.pdf
```

## Output Format

The system generates `challenge1b_output.json` with:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "input_documents": ["coastal_guide.pdf", "budget_travel.pdf"],
    "persona": "College student planning a group trip with friends",
    "job_to_be_done": "Plan a 4-day coastal adventure trip...",
    "processing_timestamp": "2025-01-20T10:30:00"
  },
  "extracted_sections": [
    {
      "document": "coastal_guide.pdf",
      "section_title": "Beach Activities and Water Sports",
      "importance_rank": 1,
      "page_number": 5
    }
  ],
  "subsection_analysis": [
    {
      "document": "coastal_guide.pdf",
      "refined_text": "Detailed content about specific activities...",
      "page_number": 5
    }
  ]
}
```
